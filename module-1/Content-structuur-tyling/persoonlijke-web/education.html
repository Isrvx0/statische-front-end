            <P> I'm doing the software developer course at vocational Education level 4.
                I had been in an open day and it was great fun. It is good course for the future and I can earn a lot of money later on.
                It also helps me to make better use of my talents and enables me to take on new challenges.
                For example, growing into other tasks and taking on responsibilities.</p>
